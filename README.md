# Experience

## TrianglZ LLC, Back End SWE Intern

- Feb 2023 – Apr 2023
- Built multiple verification endpoints using Ruby on Rails, resulting in a more efficient verification process.
- Implemented authorization policies using Pundit, enforcing compliance with data access rules.
- Wrote and maintained API documentation using Swagger, resulting in fewer integration errors.
- Contributed to a CRUD API using **Ruby on Rails**, gaining hands-on experience in Backend workflows.
- Performed database migrations, allowing the support of new API features and ensuring data preservation.

# Projects

## Relational Database Management System (Graduation Project)

- Designed an SQL parser and developed logical and physical query planning systems capable of handling multiple inner joins, sorting, filtering, and grouping operations.
- Architected a storage engine featuring optimized buffer utilization, incorporating Hash and B+ Tree indexes, and supporting variable-length relation attributes.
- Implemented support for dynamic schemas encompassing various data types and relational constraints.

## Gym Management System

- Implemented a user-friendly GUI using JavaFX for adding, modifying, and managing users' data.
- Adhered to Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodologies within our team to ensure the system's integrity and conduct ongoing regression testing while collectively implementing new features.
- Used several OOP design patterns, including Singleton and Factory patterns, resulting in a readable and extensible code base.

## Multithreaded Server-Client

- Designed a multithreaded HTTP server, maintaining a persistent connection for each client.
- Implemented a heuristic timeout algorithm, preventing the server from being overloaded.
- Designed and implemented a simple client, allowing more robust testing of the server.

## Mathematical Expression Interpreter

- Built a stack-based infix-to-postfix converter, improving expression evaluation efficiency.
- Stored evaluated expressions in a BST, enabling faster variable lookup.

## Datastructures and Algorithms Implementations

- Designed an in-memory dictionary utlizing BST, enabling quick spelling checks and corrections.
- Designed a sorting algorithms benchmark app, enabling clear comparison of algorithms efficiency.

## Operating Systems Projects

- Multithreaded matrix multiplication and merge sorting
- Built a simulator for FIFO, LRU, CLOCK, and OPTIMAL page replacement algorithms, tracking and comparing page faults across test cases.
- Designed a producer-consumer system with multiple roles (producers, counters, collectors), using semaphores to coordinate shared resources.
- Created a simplified shell supporting command parsing, execution, background processes, and process termination logging.

## Car Rental

- Website that interface with MySQL and allows renting cars.

## [Fruit Ninja](https://www.halfbrick.com/games/fruit-ninja-classic) game clone

- Used several OOP design patterns including Singleton, Factory, and Strategy, resulting in a more extensible code.
